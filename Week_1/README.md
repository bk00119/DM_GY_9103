Currently, *recipe_cards* block only includes one recipe card (bulgogi recipe) as it was meant to be. Later, multiple recipe cards can be stored as array and called inside *recipe_cards* block. 
*recipe_card* block includes a recipe name, brief description, list of ingredients, and list of instructions.

CSS file for *./index.html* mostly calling by the corresponding classnames to add styles to an item/component.

***./assets***
Directory that has image files (in */images*) and JSON file (not used right now) that has the a list of recipes with details.
